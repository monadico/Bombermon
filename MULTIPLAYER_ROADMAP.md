- 📱 Ensure responsive, smooth gameplay experience
- 🛡️ Implement graceful fallbacks and error handling

---

## 📋 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Architecture Preparation**

#### 1.1 Create Directory Structure
```
bomberman/
├── singleplayer/          # Original game (UNTOUCHED)
│   ├── game.js
│   └── singleplayer.html
├── multiplayer/           # New MultiSynq version
│   ├── multiplayer.html
│   ├── game-model.js      # MultiSynq model
│   ├── game-client.js     # Client-side logic
│   └── lobby.html         # Session management
├── sprites/               # Shared game assets
├── index.html             # Game mode selector
└── MULTIPLAYER_ROADMAP.md # This file
```

#### 1.2 MultiSynq Dependencies
- Add CDN script: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@multisynq/client@latest`
- Get API key from: https://multisynq.io/coder (free, no credit card)
- Configure session parameters:
  ```javascript
  const sessionParams = {
    appId: 'io.multisynq.yourname.bomberman',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
    name: 'bomberman-session',
    password: 'optional-password'
  };
  ```

---

### **Phase 2: State Architecture Redesign**

#### 2.1 Identify State Categories

**🌐 Shared State (Synchronized)**
- Player positions and movements
- Bomb placements and timers
- Explosion states and damage
- Destructible wall states
- Power-up spawns and collections
- Player stats (lives, bomb count, fire power)
- Game state (active, paused, game over)

**💻 Local State (Client-Only)**
- Input handling and buffering
- Visual animations and effects
- UI feedback and notifications
- Sound effects and music
- Camera/viewport management

#### 2.2 Design Event System
```javascript
// Event Types
const EVENTS = {
  PLAYER_MOVE: 'player_move',
  PLACE_BOMB: 'place_bomb',
  BOMB_EXPLODE: 'bomb_explode',
  COLLECT_POWERUP: 'collect_powerup',
  PLAYER_DAMAGE: 'player_damage',
  GAME_RESET: 'game_reset',
  PLAYER_JOIN: 'player_join',
  PLAYER_LEAVE: 'player_leave'
};
```

---

### **Phase 3: Model Implementation**

#### 3.1 Create MultiSynq Model Class
```javascript
// game-model.js
class BombermanModel extends Multisynq.Model {
  init() {
    // Initialize game state
    this.gameState = {
      players: {},
      bombs: [],
      explosions: [],
      walls: [],
      powerups: [],
      gameStatus: 'waiting'
    };
    
    // Subscribe to events
    this.subscribe('*', EVENTS.PLAYER_MOVE, this.handlePlayerMove);
    this.subscribe('*', EVENTS.PLACE_BOMB, this.handlePlaceBomb);
    // ... more event handlers
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Implement Core Game Logic
- **Movement validation**: Check collisions, boundaries
- **Bomb mechanics**: Placement limits, explosion timing
- **Damage system**: Player hits, life management
- **Power-up logic**: Collection, effects, spawning
- **Win conditions**: Last player standing, objectives

#### 3.3 Handle Race Conditions
- Ensure deterministic order for simultaneous actions
- Validate all state changes server-side
- Implement conflict resolution (e.g., power-up collection)

---

### **Phase 4: Client-Side Integration**

#### 4.1 Update Input Handling
```javascript
// Before (direct state change)
player.pos.x += MOVE_SPEED;

// After (event-based)
session.publish(playerId, EVENTS.PLAYER_MOVE, {
  direction: 'right',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

#### 4.2 Implement Optimistic Updates
- Show immediate visual feedback for local actions
- Reconcile with authoritative server state
- Handle rollbacks gracefully

#### 4.3 Synchronize Visual Elements
- Update sprites based on model state
- Smooth interpolation for movement
- Synchronized animation timing

---

### **Phase 5: Lobby & Session Management**

#### 5.1 Create Lobby Interface
- Session creation with custom names
- Join existing sessions via URL/code
- Player list and ready status
- Game start controls

#### 5.2 Implement Session Sharing
- Generate shareable join URLs
- QR codes for mobile joining
- Session discovery (optional)

#### 5.3 Player Management
- Handle player joins/disconnections
- Assign player colors/characters
- Nickname system

---

### **Phase 6: Fallback & Compatibility**

#### 6.1 Maintain Singleplayer Mode
- Keep `/singleplayer/` completely unchanged
- Ensure bots work in both modes
- Performance optimizations for local play

#### 6.2 Connection Handling
```javascript
// Graceful fallback example
try {
  await session.join(sessionParams);
  startMultiplayerMode();
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Multiplayer unavailable, falling back to singleplayer');
  startSingleplayerMode();
}
```

#### 6.3 Error Recovery
- Network interruption handling
- Reconnection logic
- State synchronization after reconnect

---

### **Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance**

#### 7.1 Test Scenarios
- ✅ Singleplayer functionality unchanged
- 🌐 2-4 player multiplayer sessions
- 📡 Network interruption recovery
- ⚡ Race condition handling
- 📱 Mobile device compatibility

#### 7.2 Performance Testing
- Latency compensation
- Frame rate consistency
- Memory usage optimization
- Battery life impact (mobile)

#### 7.3 User Experience Testing
- Intuitive session joining
- Clear error messages
- Responsive controls
- Visual feedback quality

---

### **Phase 8: UI/UX Enhancements**

#### 8.1 Multiplayer UI Elements
- Player indicators with names/colors
- Connection status indicators
- Session info panel
- Chat system (optional)

#### 8.2 Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly controls

## 🔧 **Key Technical Decisions**

### Event-Driven Architecture
All game state changes must flow through the MultiSynq event system to ensure synchronization.

### Optimistic Updates
Local actions show immediate feedback while awaiting server confirmation for responsive gameplay.

### Deterministic Logic
All game calculations must be identical across clients to prevent desynchronization.

### Graceful Degradation
The system must handle network issues and MultiSynq unavailability gracefully.
